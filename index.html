Common to those who came from nothing<br>
That nothing will haunt us<br>
Nothing will ever be enough<br>
For us to feel loved<br>
Or to deserve to be loved<br>
<br>
For how much is enough?<br>
Is it a million or a billion?<br>
Covid doesn’t discriminate<br>
But the girl I like does<br>
Golf courses over marketing courses<br>
<br>
So we shoot for six cars over six packs<br>
Then they shift and blame our physiques<br>
So I hit the gym, to sweat and toil<br>
Then I see her go into that car I dreamed of<br>
<br>
So how can I not be bitter<br>
When all one I have ever wanted always wanted something else<br>
Someone else. Never here, never me<br>
 <br>
Maybe I should look inside, maybe I should see<br>
The heinous within, which everyone evades<br>
<br>
Maybe I should learn to love myself.<br>

Its business, doesn’t go about<br>
Shortcuts, it takes that route<br>
And pitfalls, is all it found<br>
<br>
Why is everyone so pretty?<br>
Why am I always so petty?<br>
Why is ‘no’ so difficult from Betty?<br>
And why is sadness the predominant berry?<br>
<br>
It seems I am enough for not one<br>
For foreign is the word fun<br>
I work yet the work is never done<br>
For it's my escape and I never get to learn.<br>
<br>
Nice guys finish last<br>
I’ve always been trying to last<br>
Trying to be there till the end of time<br>
But that’s what she needed, not what she craved for<br>
<br>
Love is transient, just like youth<br>
Here for a good time, not for long<br>
That when the days go past, a feeling you will long<br>
The tingles and butterflies, that adorn that fleeting feeling<br>
<br>
Yet attraction is better<br>
Hot bursts of bloody desire<br>
The warmth of flesh to hold<br>
And the sweetness of a tongue to lick<br>
<br>
So why do I always mix up the two?<br>
Why so performative even when I know what is true?<br>
Why end friendship trying to venture into the wilderness?<br>
Or is that the devil I hear, as I try another shot<br>
<br>
Life is hard, relationships are harder<br>
Hardness may help sometimes, <br>
but even then something needs to be wet<br>
I look to the skies, for the beautiful mess that is my love-life<br>
<br>
To all whom love has never clicked<br>
Who always have to seek embraces from those we’d give our lives for<br>
Who live in fear of rejection, if they suddenly realized we aren’t worth the breadcrumbs they feed us<br>
I say: The road may be dark, but walk it with a high head<br>
For you are not a loan.</div><br /><h4>Author notes</h4><p class="richp">A momento to how I feel atm</p></div><br /><hr /><br /><div class="p" data-poem-id="16672197" style="page-break-after:always"><h2 class="title" style="margin-bottom: 2px;padding-left:0"><a href="https://allpoetry.com/poem/16672197-The-Simp-and-the-Pimp-by-Virgo-Alpha-adult" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none">The Simp and the Pimp</a></h2>by Virgo Alpha on August  6, 2022.&nbsp; &copy; Benson Mugure, All rights reserved <div class="body"><p>Jonathan &amp; Brian<br>
<br>
Who are you, Brian?<br>
That when you make a call, not clarion<br>
She runs like a lion<br>
Wastes no time on Valon<br>
Pays no heed to fashion<br>
So that she may meet you still turned on<br>
And tend to you with her heels on<br>
Who are you, Brian?<br>
<br>
======================================================<br>
<br>
Just a man, Jonathan<br>
Whose worth is tied to no one’s barn<br>
Who sleeps heavily after reaching Canaan<br>
When Linda makes him feel manly and fun<br>
For we all need warmth sometimes, man,<br>
But what we do to achieve that, fan,<br>
Is what defines us more than the food chain can<br>
Will you kneel and beg her like only you can,<br>
Or will you ask and demand regardless of the burn?<br>
<br>
======================================================<br>
<br>
Don’t you dare say it, her name I will guard<br>
On your foul tongue, it should never land<br>
For it’s always spiced up, and never bland<br>
Truth rarely uttered, like a foreign gland<br>
And sweet words reside, without any honesty brand<br>
Swaying all and sundry, to give their souls and the rand<br>
And get nothing in return, nothing anyone can stand<br>
For you stab them in the back, right there in the band<br>
<br>
======================================================<br>
<br>
Foul, you called my tongue?<br>
It’s been places, without a bang<br>
That you dreamt of, when your phone rang<br>
To cancel your meeting, and the way you had sang<br>
That she may meet you, for Netflix and chill<br>
More you did want, but feared to drill<br>
Then you watched, as she slipped away from the kill<br>
To be drilled, by more direct fellows full of thrill<br>
Oh Johnny! What do you feel?<br>
<br>
======================================================<br>
<br>
I feel everything,<br>
For that is the very thing<br>
That you fear most, oh dear King<br>
To feel, yet that is living<br>
I’ve given a lot and I’m still giving<br>
For what is love if not the stance<br>
Of giving all, chance after chance<br>
Not counting any, leaving all in a trance<br>
As you enjoy life and join the dance?<br>
<br>
======================================================<br>
<br>
Love?? How naive!<br>
I’m not one, into oblivion to dive<br>
For how do you know, that you’ll return alive<br>
For a cat may have nine, but I don’t have even five<br>
And I must preserve this, this organ that makes me thrive<br>
And to this end, away I will drive<br>
All that want to break it, or invade it like the beehive<br>
I leave love to novels, and the other telenovela<br>
And maybe to woo a girl now and then, when a lie I tell her<br>
<br>
======================================================<br>
<br>
So you admit it, you liar<br>
That lie you do, and with a false fire<br>
Engrave your words, needless of a dryer<br>
For you never water your promises, never let them grow higher<br>
Than you need them to be, for them to seem truer<br>
Than they really are, and that is your game’s ball<br>
Did Linda know, that you were as bitter as gall<br>
Or was she too naive, just another girl<br>
For you to hoodwink, that you may stand tall<br>
<br>
======================================================<br>
<br>
Why do you ask, do you not know<br>
Or do you fear truth, and wish to lie low<br>
As low as she did, when we all wanted a little bow<br>
And obeyed she did, followed us in tow<br>
Do you want more, all the details raw<br>
Or should I leave it there, off-balance not to throw<br>
And leave a few things to her, so that she may grow<br>
Older and more aware, of what Johnny really thinks of her eye brow<br>
<br>
======================================================<br>
<br>
You pimped her, you devil!?<br>
Pulled her down, lowered her to your level?<br>
Of mice and roaches, who are all your rival<br>
Does it pleasure you, to tear out a flower<br>
Like making cake, without flour<br>
Or are you sick, and it’s your <em>dawa</em><br>
Your getaway, your secret tower<br>
For you know the truth, and it makes you sour<br>
That you are useless, apart from a fake roar<br>
<br>
======================================================<br>
<br>
I’m not bitter Johnny, that sounds a lot like you<br>
For you attach emotions everywhere, even to the loo<br>
Don’t you know that everything has a purpose, even a zoo<br>
Some are to be seen and admired, but never a hand laid<br>
Others are meant to be killed and served, that’s what destiny said<br>
You should think about that, and don’t be afraid<br>
For the truth hurts, much more than an external raid<br>
And unlike the arm, the heart has no first aid<br>
So guard yours against one and all, even if it’s Linda’s jade<br>
<br>
======================================================<br>

For passion you lack when my success calls,<br>
Must our lives rhyme even when yours falls?<br>
Or is ours a ‘for better’ and never ‘for worse’?<br>
<br>
I once kept one, for whom touch was taboo<br>
No hugs, no shakes, I wondered how to woo<br>
Nothing worked, and I wondered if we would too<br>
Or we’d be there for the help, just like the loo<br>
Or perhaps like a falling rockstar, off stage we would boo<br>
<br>
Am I wrong, have I never made you feel good?<br>
Or was it all in my head, as we ate food?<br>
For you pulled back, and aside I would brood<br>
I expected better, or at least not this crude<br>
For I can no longer visit you, no, not in your room<br>
Nor seat on your bed, for away you’ve swept me with your broom<br>
<br>
Finally it’s Furahi-day, the weekend is here<br>
Alcohol and the night life, and everything would draw you near<br>
And again you would urge, with nothing to fear<br>
To let go and let loose, regardless of what the future would bear<br>
But where are you, in the middle of the week?<br>
When the days weigh heavy, making me feel weak<br>
Or are we all pleasure, and never a light wick<br>
<br>
Another was my oldest, and closest by far<br>
Not in time or age, but in soul and fur<br>
For like birds of a feather, on the same course we traveled<br>
Both in school and in life, together we went<br>
And when sick I fell, warm you had me kept<br>
With your drugs and snacks, my illness we would vent<br>
But in the middle of a stupid brawl, you type in wrath<br>
That I had to go, and myself educate<br>
<br>
Netflix and chill, netflix and chill<br>
With my netflix girl, at home I would feel<br>
Not for privacy or attention, but for your kiss I would kill<br>
Film after film, we watched without a fee<br>
And when with me you couldn’t be, password you gave without a thought<br>
Not once or twice, but frequently we fought<br>
About one and all, nothing and everything<br>
But this one feels different, something about it is terminal<br>
Your reputation you chose, and to oblivion you threw our ball<br>
<br>
And yet likes attract, it can’t all be them<br>
I must be flawed, I can’t be a gem<br>
Maybe I need air, maybe I need hemp<br>
To think of all this, without feeling the shame<br>
For when alone I feel, I recall who to blame<br>
Is it my upbringing, that had me plunged into fame?<br>
Or my lack of a father, for he rarely came<br>
To blame others for one’s misgivings, is weakness to claim<br>
And I am not weak, no, not in this game<br>
For when the greats walk the hall of fame, I will do the same<br>

Hit him, slapped him, hung him on the beam,<br>
With his tie on his neck, lifeless he would seem<br>
I cry, oh why, never a killer I would deem<br>
He had it coming, good job team<br>
<br>
Yet he wasn’t always like this<br>
Flowers he would frequently bring<br>
To my parents’ abode where I was living,<br>
Alas! What a lovely being<br>
<br>
“Martha!” Papa once called,<br>
‘Where’s my boy?’ the men had a bond,<br>
I sneered, he laughed, for he knew I was fond<br>
Of the man, the son, that papa had found<br>
<br>
On an outing, about nothing I vent<br>
Keenly he listens, and better I felt<br>
Then suddenly, without warning, on one knee he knelt<br>
Tupo site, tupo site, my tears went<br>
<br>
All white, would our wedding be<br>
And spacious, for he spared no fee<br>
“My queen!” He’d call me for the key<br>
Bright as the stars, a future I would see<br>
<br>
And yet, nothing lasts forever<br>
For in a month or two, a visitor drew near<br>
Now eating for two, the task was here<br>
Without regrets, I had nothing to fear<br>
<br>
No, I can’t let you touch me<br>
Dangerous for the baby, that would be<br>
Don’t you know this? You who would bring me tea<br>
When dizzy I felt, like on a boat at sea<br>
<br>
Alas! The little man came forth<br>
And not alone, but with a girl to behold<br>
My children! I am now a part of the fold<br>
The women mothers, with whom the world can never go cold<br>
<br>
<br>
No, not yet<br>
Don’t touch me, let us not make that bet<br>
I’m still sore, from the months I bent<br>
Bearing our kids, while you had nothing to fret<br>
<br>
No, nothing it must be<br>
Lipstick it seems, but doubt I mustn’t<br>
For the the sweetest thing, is the love he gives<br>
Don’t overthink, Martha, nothing it must be<br>
<br>
“Anyone home!?” Awake it made me<br>
My love! it can’t be<br>
You don’t drink, this must be fake<br>
A nightmare it must be, or reality that is half bake<br>
<br>
‘You can’t keep doing this,” I plead<br>
“It is not good for kid,”<br>
For the son was dead<br>
Out of life he had bled<br>
<br>
Maybe I am to blame<br>
For I could not change frame<br>
Don’t! I would shout when he came<br>
Close to me, after our son was gone<br>
<br>
But once, my shouting failed to stop him<br>
Stronger he seemed, and me he overcame<br>
He took what was his, or his he would deem<br>
Apart from mine, it had never been<br>
<br>
Now, this is how we live<br>
Two strangers, with hearts bereaved<br>
Come and go, days come and leave<br>
Silence reigns supreme, with nothing to believe<br>
<br>
He raped me again, claiming it is his right<br>
I wonder if he is the man I married, and saw our future bright<br>
Is it the same man who now cannot tell wrong from right?<br>
Believe I can’t, even if god I meet<br>
<br>
And every day, after home he had left<br>
I would scheme and plan, the end he would meet<br>
For that was the only way, this is how I felt<br>
To rescue my daughter, from the dad I had bred<br>
<br>
And every night, when the guy came back<br>
I would stab him, his neck I would choke<br>
With all my strength, to bite and not bark<br>
For I cannot let my daughter grow up with this freak<br>
<br>
Who cares if it was all in my mind?<br>
For we had vows that together bind<br>
Us for eternity, even death could not find<br>
A way to part us, for we are each other’s kind<br>
</div><br /><h4>Author notes</h4><p class="richp">A mirror for all victims to reflect on</p></div><br /><hr /><br /><div class="p" data-poem-id="16668766" style="page-break-after:always"><h2 class="title" style="margin-bottom: 2px;padding-left:0"><a href="https://allpoetry.com/poem/16668766-Deathbed-Regrets-by-Virgo-Alpha" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none">Deathbed Regrets</a></h2>by Virgo Alpha on August  4, 2022.&nbsp; &copy; Benson Mugure, All rights reserved <div class="body">No, not really, I am not in pain<br>
Or maybe I am, I can’t exactly explain<br>
For what should I feel, when every single gain<br>
Proves to be useless, baseless and in vain?<br>
<br>
I’ll rest here, I won’t rise<br>
Take away the juice, and the rice<br>
This is certain, no rolling of dice<br>
For kings and queens, all die like mice<br>
<br>
Where is Junior, and Becky?<br>
Are they not here, that’s unlikely<br>
I mean, I know we weren’t close, not besty<br>
But they’re my children, my own charms lucky<br>
<br>
I’ve gained a lot in life, most of it wealth<br>
I spared nothing in this pursuit, not even my health<br>
And when night came, and my dreams seemed further<br>
Rose would keep me warm, as my kids’ mother<br>
<br>
Oh Rose, my Rose<br>
A rose by any other name? There’s no such dose<br>
And when morning came, as always I rose<br>
And forgot all about her, that’s the path I chose<br>
<br>
Not just her, but everyone who was close<br>
All the friends and family, I brushed aside like a boss<br>
I might blame greed, but I didn’t have a cause<br>
For loneliness and more, was the price it cos’<br>
<br>
I was into girls, both young and old<br>
No matter the age, I brought them into my fold<br>
I was never warm with them though, I was always cold<br>
For my heart was dead, and all that was left was my desire in bold<br>
<br>
Yet that was never my compass, never my north star<br>
For profits I cherished, never kept my chequebook far<br>
And even when lives were involved, I never lowered my bar<br>
For what is life, if not existence’s fancy car?<br>
<br>
I regret nothing, nothing that I did<br>
For in all I was laughing, deed after deed<br>
What I regret most is not a thing, but a seed<br>
The one I failed to plant, the things left without a lid<br>
<br>
Like being at work, when Rose died<br>
Junior and beck’, tears couldn’t be dyed<br>
Yet I couldn't spare a speck, couldn’t let the deal fade<br>
Not even to lay her to rest, not even goodbye to bid<br>
<br>
And in the eleventh hour, of the life I lived<br>
I look back through the door, to see how my space will be filled<br>
Maybe not by the best, maybe by an average kid<br>
For I trained no one, in whose hands the scepter would be laid<br>
<br>
As light fades, and my time draws near<br>
I thought I’d be relieved, I thought I would go without fear<br>
But after losing face, and all I held dear<br>
I can’t help but reminisce, of all the times I could have done better<br>

Mind not your past sorrow<br>
For money we shall borrow<br>
To fill our last burrow<br>
<br>
Election! It’s out time<br>
To care of even those without a dime<br>
And when life tastes like lime<br>
Remember it is we who can make it thyme<br>
<br>
All false, swear I can<br>
I have no crimes, crossed no line<br>
For that you see, it’s all mine<br>
Hard I work, and wealth I mine<br>
<br>
I’m not foreign, I’ve grown up with you<br>
And for the problems you face, there’s nothing I won’t do<br>
Don’t fall for the rest, however much they try to fool<br>
For in this liberation struggle, you know we’re your best tool<br>
<br>
On that day, wake up early<br>
Don’t mind your corn, or your barley<br>
Leave the rest, don’t wake them from the folly<br>
When we take the oath, we’ll leave all jolly<br>
<br>
What of the last term, is that your query?<br>
Things went sour, let’s blame it on the crony<br>
For our quest was just, and our resolve strong<br>
But things happen, and last term they went wrong<br>
<br>
The time draws near, battle shouts I hear<br>
Remember to vote, or consequences bear<br>
For the lives you want, politics you must treasure<br>
Lives might be important, but victory is dearer<br>
<br>
As I come to a close, this is my clarion call<br>
Beware of the others, their promises you mustn’t fall<br>
They lack proof, and their play is foul<br>
They’re not like us, we who at your feet crawl<br>
